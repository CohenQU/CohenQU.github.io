    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown incredible promise at training high-performing agents to solve high-dimensional continuous control tasks in a particular training environment. However, to be useful in real-world settings, long-lived agents must perform well across a range of environmental conditions. Naively applying deep RL to a task where environment conditions may vary from episode to episode can be data inefficient. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a method that discovers structure in an agent’s high-dimensional continuous action space to speed up learning across a range of environmental conditions. Whereas prior work on finding so-called latent action spaces requires expert demonstrations or on-task experience, we instead propose to discover the latent, lower-dimensional action space in a simulated environment and then transfer the learned action space for training over a distribution of environments. We evaluate our novel method on randomized variants of simulated MuJoCo environments and find that, when there is a lower-dimensional action space to exploit, our method significantly increases data efficiency. For instance, in the Ant environment, our method reduces the 8-dimensional action space to a 3-dimensional action space and doubles the median return achieved after a training budget of 2 million timesteps."

    "title": "Polite or Direct? Conversation Design of a Smart Display for Older Adults Based on Politeness Theory.",
    "authors": ["Yaxin Hu", "Yuxiao Qu", "Adam Maus", "Bilge Mutlu"],
    "conference": "Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems",
    "date": "April 2022",
    "abstract": "Conversational interfaces increasingly rely on human-like dialogue to offer a natural experience. However, relying on dialogue involving multiple exchanges for even simple tasks can overburden users, particularly older adults. In this paper, we explored the use of politeness theory in conversation design to alleviate this burden and improve user experience. To achieve this goal, we categorized the voice interaction offered by a smart display application designed for older adults into seven major speech acts: request, suggest, instruct, comment, welcome, farewell, and repair. We identified face needs for each speech act, applied politeness strategies that best address these needs, and tested the ability of these strategies to shape the perceived politeness of a voice assistant in an online study (n = 64). Based on the findings of this study, we designed direct and polite versions of the system and conducted a field study (n = 15) in which participants used each of the versions for five days at their homes. Based on five factors merged from our qualitative findings, we identified four distinctive user personas—socially oriented follower, socially oriented leader, utility oriented follower, and utility oriented leader—that can inform personalized design of smart displays."
